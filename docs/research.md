## Hypophysis
- Practice listening with different voices might enhance overall language learning stability.
  - [ ] Are there situations in which one content bond to one voice helps better with learning, or listening to familiar voices even one's own voices.

## Audio Processing
Recomendations:
- Avoid long reference audio (<12s for F5-TTS) and leave proper silence space at the end, for better generation.
- Add some spaces (blank: " ") or punctuations (e.g. "," ".") to explicitly introduce some pauses.
  - Add space at the end of template text.
